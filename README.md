This repository demonstrates an issue with inconsistent error handling in the Firebase JavaScript SDKs.  Specifically, certain errors may not conform to standard JavaScript error objects, making robust error handling difficult. The `firebaseBug.js` file shows an example scenario, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a solution implementing more comprehensive error checking.  This is crucial for building reliable applications that gracefully handle potential failures from Firebase.
